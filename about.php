				Palomino Blackwing is a beautiful building. 
				Commanding but not imposing, it is a thoughtful 
				neighbor to the stately Deco buildings that surround 
				it; a building that's at home in its historic surroundings, 
				yet utterly modern at every&nbsp;turn.
				<br><br>
				Its elegant proportions and handsome pale-gold brick facade 
				make it a welcoming beacon to the offices, restaurants and 
				boutiques that share the downtown. Inside, every aspect of 
				the space has been considered, from the switch glass bathrooms 
				to the “no handles” custom millwork cabinets. All of Palomino 
				Blackwing's features seamlessly work together, taking precision 
				to a whole new level of&nbsp;brilliance.
				<br><br>
				But this isn't the only thing that makes Palomino Blackwing such 
				a unique place. Take a walk through the city streets. Admire the 
				washes of dappled light and treetop views from the west, and the 
				brilliant Atlantic Ocean from the east. Step into the hotel-like 
				cocktail lounge on the ground floor. It's the consideration of 
				pleasure in the&nbsp;everyday.
				<br><br>
				Every space, every texture and every satisfying click of a door 
				has been designed to bring the residents of Palomino Blackwing 
				pleasure and&nbsp;comfort.
			</p>
			<p class="copy-block-copy">
				<!-- col2 -->
				And yet this pleasure serves a very serious purpose – making people 
				who live and work here happy. Happier, more productive and more 
				sociable – more engaged with each&nbsp;other.
				<br><br>
				Because the essence of any place is surely the people; the feelings 
				they entertain about a place, how they interact with it, and within 
				it, with each other. Established and generous, Palomino Blackwing 
				is a place to enjoy, and to be a part&nbsp;of.
				<br><br>
				The enjoyment isn't limited to residents, either. Pascal &amp; Sabine, 
				the ground floor lounge and restaurant, offers an inspiring dose of 
				culture to admirers of fine food. The sense of belonging is both 
				architectural and&nbsp;social.
				<br><br>
				That's as it should be. This is a building that's been designed to be 
				an important part of the fabric of Asbury Park. Built to outlast trends 
				and to adapt to the changing needs of its residents, it is a deeply 
				sustainable&nbsp;place.
				<br><br>
				Perhaps, then, the essence of Palomino Blackwing can best be described 
				as one of "just right:" a perfect complement to its neighborhood, to 
				its city, and above all to the people who fill&nbsp;it.
